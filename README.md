# NLP with Markov Chain Model

## Overview

Welcome to the **NLP with Markov Chain Model** project! This repository contains several C programs designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Markov Chain models. Our primary focus is on generating text and simulating various data structures and games using this powerful probabilistic model.

## Project Contents

This repository includes the following C programs:

1. **Linked List Implementation (`linked_list.c`)**
   - A program that demonstrates the basic operations of a linked list data structure. This includes insertion, deletion, and traversal of linked list elements.

2. **Markov Chain Model (`markov_chain.c`)**
   - This program implements a Markov Chain model for generating text. It reads input text and creates a probabilistic model that can generate new text based on the input. This is a core part of our NLP focus.

3. **Snakes and Ladders Game (`snakes_and_ladders.c`)**
   - A simulation of the classic Snakes and Ladders game. This program showcases the use of the Markov Chain model in a different context, simulating game progress and outcomes.

4. **Tweets Generator (`tweets_generator.c`)**
   - Utilizing the Markov Chain model, this program generates random tweets based on a corpus of sample tweets. It's a fun and practical example of NLP and text generation in action.

## Getting Started

To get started with these programs, you will need a C compiler such as `gcc`. Follow the instructions below to compile and run each program.

### Compilation Instructions

1. **Linked List Implementation**

   ```sh
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ./linked_list
   ```

2. **Markov Chain Model**

   ```sh
   gcc markov_chain.c -o markov_chain
   ./markov_chain
   ```

3. **Snakes and Ladders Game**

   ```sh
   gcc snakes_and_ladders.c -o snakes_and_ladders
   ./snakes_and_ladders
   ```

4. **Tweets Generator**

   ```sh
   gcc tweets_generator.c -o tweets_generator
   ./tweets_generator
   ```
